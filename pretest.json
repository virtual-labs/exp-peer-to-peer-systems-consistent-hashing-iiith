      "question": "What is a distributed hash table (DHT)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A single table stored in a single computer's memory",
        "b": "A table of key-value pairs stored across multiple computers",
        "c": "A table stored in a relational database",
        "d": "A hash table with a fixed size"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A DHT is distributed across multiple computers.",
        "b": "Correct. A DHT stores key-value pairs across multiple computers.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A DHT is not limited to relational databases.",

      "question": "How does naive hashing distribute key-value pairs across a cluster?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By randomly selecting a machine",
        "b": "By using the modulo operation on the hash of the key and the number of machines",
        "c": "By storing all keys in a single machine",
        "d": "By storing keys alphabetically across machines"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Naive hashing is not random.",
        "b": "Correct. Naive hashing uses the modulo operation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Naive hashing distributes keys across multiple machines.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Keys are not stored alphabetically."

      "question": "What is a major drawback of the naive hashing method when adding a new machine to the cluster?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases the number of hash collisions",
        "b": "It does not allow for even distribution of keys",
        "c": "It requires recomputing the hash of all keys, leading to massive data movement",
        "d": "It reduces the total storage capacity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Hash collisions are not the main issue.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The distribution can still be even.",
        "c": "Correct. Adding a machine requires recomputing hashes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Storage capacity is not reduced."
